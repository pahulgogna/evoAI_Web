# EvoAI Web

EvoAI is a web-ui for running LLMs locally or in the cloud, with agentic capabilities.

## Features
- **Web Search:** LLMs can search the web using a built in web-scraper, fetching relevant information about any topic.
- **Tool Calling:** LLMs can call tools based on the requirements.
- **Tool Creation:** LLMs can create required tools, and add them to their arsenal for future use. 

*Tools are run in a sandboxed environment for maintaining security.*
